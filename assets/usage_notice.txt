Adapt Authoring Bundle Setup is an installation script and its open source is available at GitHub, under repository Adapt_Authoring_Bundle_Setup. The code is based on the Inno Setup, a free and open-source installer for Windows (https://jrsoftware.org).

The Adapt Authoring Bundle Setup has no application software or product of its own; it's simply an install script to automate the installation of Git, Node.js, MongoDB, Grunt, and Adapt Authoring tool.

Instead, it uses URL links to the official third-party sites (Git, Node.js, MongoDB, Grunt, and Adapt Authoring) to download their software, and only then stores the official installers for Git, Node.js, and MongoDB in its own setup folder. In addition, it uses two batch scripts to install the packages for Grunt and Adapt Authoring.
